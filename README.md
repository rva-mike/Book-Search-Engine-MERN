# Book-Search-Engine-MERN

  ## Description
   This app was a refactor of a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, into a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. The app allows users to save book searches to the back end.
